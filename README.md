# mimicBot
## a lichess bot for the mimicChess engine
This code provides a bot wrapper for running the [mimicChess](https://github.com/nrxszvo/mimicChess) engine on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org) (see the [mimicChess demo site](https://chessbot.michaelhorgan.me))

mimicBot is derived from the [lichess-bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) example repo and is built with Pytorch, Flask, and Celery to serve mimicBot from a Google Cloud virtual machine.
