## A Lichess Bot for the mimicChess Engine

This repository provides a bot wrapper for running the [mimicChess](https://github.com/nrxszvo/mimicChess) engine on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org). For more information, check out the [mimicChess demo site](https://chessbot.michaelhorgan.me).

**mimicBot** is derived from the [lichess-bot](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) example repository. It is built using **Pytorch**, **Flask**, and **Celery** to serve the bot from a **Google Cloud virtual machine**.
