# mimicBot - a lichess bot for the mimicChess engine
This code provides a [lichess](https://lichess.org) bot for running the mimicChess engine on lichess.org (see [MimicTetBot](https://chessbot.michaelhorgan.me))
(Check out the [mimicChess](https://github.com/nrxszvo/mimicChess) repo for mimicTestBot's engine source and training procedure)

mimicBot is derived from [lichess's bot example repo](https://github.com/lichess-bot-devs/lichess-bot) and is built with Flask, Celery, and Apache2 to serve mimicBot from a Google Cloud virtual machine.
